</div>
<div>
- BUT, other software will usually give you the same answer
- Good science does NOT equal using `R`

## Experience with `R`?
```{r, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
data <- read.table("./data/Survey-3.csv", sep=",", header=T)
data <- data[,6]
levels(data)[6] <- "I should be teaching this course!"

data <- factor(data, levels(data)[c(2,1,5,3,4,6)])

freq <- table(data)
par(mai=c(1,4,0,1), bg=NA )
barplot(rev(freq), horiz = TRUE, las=1, xlab = "frequency")

> - Graduates lacking mathematical skills.

> ...examining the mathematical/quantitative skills (and possibly also computer-
programming) content of biological sciences programmes.

# Statistical foundations

## Why do we need statistics?  

* Our job is to try to make sense of the world by collecting, analysing and interpreting data  
* The truth is beyond our reach, but we can try to get as close to the truth as possible   
* Statistics may be defined as...  

> ...methods for making wise decisions in the face of uncertainty. 

<p class="author">W.A. Wallis</p>


## Why do we need statistics?  

<div>
<img style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left:0px" src="./pictures/the-truth.jpg" width=100%>
</div>

## Why do we need to do statistics? {.build}

<div>
* We want to describe what the world looks like
* It is impossible to measure everything  
* We can only measure a sample  
* Our sample is _assumed_ to be representative of the population at large (_i.e._ random and unbiased)
* The larger our sample, to closer we get to the truth
</div>
<div>
* Population &rarr; Representative (random) sample &rarr; Population
* Real world &rarr; Data &rarr; (Statistical) model &rarr; Real world
</div>
<div>
> All models are wrong, but some are useful.

<p class="author">George E.P. Box</p>
</div>

## Estimating the mean
* The mean of our sample will be related to the true mean
* Because of random sampling, it will pretty much never be identical to the true mean
* However, _on average_ the mean of our sample is equal to the true mean (_i.e._ our estimate is unbiased/accurate)
* The variation in our _estimated_ means around the _true_ mean goes down when sample size increases (the precision increases)

<!-- ## Why do we need statistics?  {.build} -->

<!-- <div> -->
<!-- * The challenge:    -->
<!--     + Everything varies   -->
<!--     + A random sample may by chance not be representative of the population    -->
<!--     + Samples from two populations that are very different may be identical    -->
<!--     + Samples from identical populations may be very different    -->
<!-- </div> -->
<!-- <div> -->
<!-- * We need to distinguish between interesting (biological) and uninteresting variation (sampling variation, error, noise)     -->
<!-- * How much variation do we expect by chance alone, if nothing interesting is     -->
<!-- going on?   -->
<!-- * *The null-hypothesis* -->
<!-- </div> -->





## Null hypothesis testing
<div style="float: left; width: 80%">

* Null hypothesis $H_0$: There is no relationship, no difference...
* A good null hypothesis is capable of rejection, *i.e.* falsifiable
* The null hypothesis can be proven false, but not right
* Do we have enough evidence against the null hypothesis to reject it?
* 'Innocent until proven guilty'
* **Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence**  

* $H_0$: All swans are white  
* Lots of white swans don't make $H_0$ true  
* One black swan makes $H_0$ false  

</div>

<figcaption style="margin-bottom: 50px">Karl Popper</figcaption>
<img src="./pictures/Black_Swans.jpg" width="100%">
</div>

## Null hypothesis testing {.build}
<div>
* Can we reject null-hypothesis $H_0$ in favour of the alternative hypothesis $H_1$?
* Is the result *unlikely* to be the result of chance, *i.e.* if the null-hypothesis
were true?
* The probability of finding an effect that is at least as big if the null-hypothesis were true: *p-value*
* Is the variation **statistically significant**?
</div>
<div>
* Unlikely: often defined as *less than 5% of the time*
</div>

## Null hypothesis testing {.build}

* Difference between groups:
    + The means of two samples will never be the same, even if they come from the same population
    + How likely are we to observe a difference between two samples at least this large _by chance alone_?

<div>
* Relationship between two continuous variables:
    + The correlation between two variables is never exactly zero
    + How likely are we to observe a correlation that is at least this strong by chance alone?
</div>
<div>
* Probability (p-value) smaller than, for example, 0.05?
* Statistical significance   
</div>

## Type I and Type II errors
* We can make two types of mistakes:

* **Type I error:** Incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis (p-value)
    + Similar to an incorrect diagnosis, a false fire alarm  


* **Type II error:** Failure to reject a false null hypothesis (1-power)  
    + Similar to a diagnostic test missing a disease, a fire but alarm not going off

|                     | $H_0$: true            | $H_0$: false             |
|--------------------:|:----------------------:|:------------------------:|
| test: do not reject |  correct               |  Type II error (1-power) |
| test: reject        | Type I error (p-value) | correct (power)          |


## The limitations of p-values {.build}
<div>
* Any threshold (*e.g.* p = 0.05) is arbitrary
* Be sceptical of attempts to turn a continuous variable into a *yes* or *no* answer!
</div>
<div>
* Probability of finding an effect at least as big if the null-hypothesis is true
* NOT the probability that the null-hypothesis is true
</div>
<div>
* Highly dependent on sample size
* Not a measure of the size of the effect
* *'Is there an effect?'* rather than *'How strong is the effect?'*
</div>
<div>
* P-values are not 'wrong' but have their limitations
* Always report p-value *and* effect size and consider alternatives
</div>
